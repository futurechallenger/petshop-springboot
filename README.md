## Petshop build by Spring Boot

For now, it's all in developing. I will add more details about this soon.

  * Spring Boot with **MyBatis**.
  * Log
  * other cool stuff
  * user spring cloud

OK, no matter what we have entity, mapper and restcontrollers. What we need now is Services.
To add all these stuff is a piece of cake.
